# Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems
## Code of Ethics
* Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline.
* Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.) 
* Pick a site of your choice and read the AUP.  Select a policy of interest and report your findings (include a link to the site in your report.) 
Many organizations that provide technology services to a group of constituents or the public require agreement to an acceptable use policy (AUP) before those services can be accessed. Similar to a code of ethics, this policy outlines what is allowed and what is not allowed while someone is using the organization’s services. An everyday example of this is the terms of service that must be agreed to before using the public Wi-Fi at Starbucks, McDonald’s, or even a university. Here is an example of an acceptable use policy from Virginia Tech.
Just as with a code of ethics, these acceptable use policies specify what is allowed and what is not allowed. Again, while some of the items listed are obvious to most, others are not so obvious:
“Borrowing” someone else’s login ID and password is prohibited.
Using the provided access for commercial purposes, such as hosting your own business website, is not allowed.
Sending out unsolicited email to a large group of people is prohibited.
Also as with codes of ethics, violations of these policies have various consequences. In most cases, such as with Wi-Fi, violating the acceptable use policy will mean that you will lose your access to the resource. While losing access to Wi-Fi at Starbucks may not have a lasting impact, a university student getting banned from the university’s Wi-Fi (or possibly all network resources) could have a large impact.
## Intellectual Property

* From the chapter follow the link to the WIPO.  What is the purpose and importance of the WIPO? 

* Using links in the chapter explain how a copyright is obtained and the benefit of registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office. Explain why it might be important to copyright the svg image you created. 

* If the svg image you created became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, explain the role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property. 
 
## Information Collection
* Explain how COPPA, FERPA and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the Internet.
